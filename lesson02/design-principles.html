            <p>The website has the rule of thirds in the sense their homepage can be split up into three sections. 
                Each section has a different eye-catching item. The top half is the header with the nav bar and colorful colors. 
                The middle has a rotating slideshow of their products and the bottom half of the page shows projects. 
                There is something the eye can see on each part of the site. </p>

        to the left that help keep things grouped and professional. The alignment is meant to catch the eye and even 
        that cards at the bottom and both center and left are aligned.
